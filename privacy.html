        <h1>Privacy Policy for RozgarAI</h1>
        <p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how RozgarAI ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you through our Android mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> This includes personal details you provide when you create an account or update your profile, such as your name, email address, phone number (optional), education, work experience, location, job role preferences, language preferences, and specifically, your skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> We store your conversations with the RozgarAI chatbot to provide context, personalize future interactions, and improve our AI models.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> If you use the voice input feature, we temporarily process your voice recordings via Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to convert them into text for the chatbot. The audio files are not persistently stored by us after transcription.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may automatically collect certain information about how you use the App, such as features accessed, time spent in the app, and crash reports, typically via services like Firebase Crashlytics or Analytics. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the App's features and functionality.</li>
            <li>Personalizing your experience, such as providing relevant job recommendations, skill gap analysis, and tailored chatbot responses.</li>
            <li>Authenticating users and managing accounts.</li>
            <li>Communicating with you, including responding to inquiries and sending service-related notifications (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Analyzing usage trends to improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the security and integrity of our services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers solely for the purpose of operating and improving the App. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for backend services like user authentication, database storage (Firestore for profile data and chat history), and potentially analytics/crash reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Your chat messages (text only) are sent to OpenAI's API to generate AI responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Cloud Speech-to-Text:</strong> Used to transcribe your voice input if you use that feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Jsearch API (or similar job provider):</strong> Used to fetch live job listings relevant to your profile or queries. Your specific profile data is not necessarily shared, but search parameters (like job title, location, skills) might be sent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These third parties are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the services they provide to us. We may also disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of others.</p>

        <h2>4. Permissions Requested</h2>
        <p>To provide its full functionality, RozgarAI requests the following permissions on your Android device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Microphone (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO):</strong>
                Required to enable the voice input feature, allowing you to speak your queries to the chatbot. Audio is processed for transcription via Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and is not stored long-term by us.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Internet (android.permission.INTERNET):</strong>
                Essential for communicating with our backend services (Firebase), third-party APIs (OpenAI, Google Cloud, Jsearch), and fetching necessary data like job listings.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Notifications (android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS - Android 13+):</strong>
                Allows the App to send you notifications, for example, when a background job search or skill analysis is complete and ready for viewing. You can manage notification preferences in your device settings.
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>We only request permissions that are necessary for specific features, and we strive to ask for them contextually when you first try to use that feature.</p>
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2> <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2> <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services and comply with our legal obligations. You can request the deletion of your account and associated personal data at any time through the profile or settings section within the App. Upon receiving a valid deletion request, we will permanently delete your personal data from our active systems within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 30 days), unless retention is required by law or for legitimate operational purposes (like backups, which are cycled out over time).</p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2> <p>You have the right to access, update, or correct your profile information directly within the App. You also have the right to request the deletion of your personal data as described above. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights regarding your data; please contact us if you wish to exercise such rights.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2> <p>RozgarAI is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately so we can take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy within the App or via other appropriate communication methods (e.g., email) before the changes take effect. We encourage you to review this policy regularly.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2> <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:</p>
