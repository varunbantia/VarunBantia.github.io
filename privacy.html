        <h1>Privacy Policy for RozgarAI</h1>
        <p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 8, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how RozgarAI ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you through our Android mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in the following categories:</p>
        
        <h4>A. Information You Provide to Us</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account and Profile Data:</strong> When you create an account, you provide information like your <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email address</strong>. To personalize your experience, you may also add <strong>profile details</strong> such as your education, work experience, location, desired job role, and skills.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We collect and store the content you create and save within the app. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your <strong>Chat History</strong> with the chatbot.</li>
                    <li>Your answers for the <strong>HR and Technical Self-Assessment</strong> features.</li>
                    <li>Your saved <strong>STAR Method stories</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Your <strong>Company Research notes</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Your <strong>Checklist tasks</strong> and any <strong>reminder times</strong> you set.</li>
                    <li>Your saved/bookmarked <strong>HR questions, technical questions, and technical links</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>B. Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> If you use the voice input (microphone) feature, your audio recording is sent to our backend to be transcribed into text. The audio file is deleted immediately after transcription and is not stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage and Device Data:</strong> We automatically collect information about how you use the App, such as features accessed and crash reports, using services like Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics. This helps us fix bugs and improve the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide and Personalize Our Service:</strong> To power the chatbot, provide AI feedback on your practice answers, generate custom study guides, find relevant job listings, and store your notes and saved items.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate With You:</strong> To send you notifications for chat replies (if you are outside the app) and to deliver reminders you set for your checklist tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticate and Manage Your Account:</strong> To securely log you in and manage your user data.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze and Improve the App:</strong> To understand how users interact with our features, fix bugs, and develop new tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Security:</strong> To protect our services from fraud or abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We only share it with trusted service providers who help us operate the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Our Backend Service Provider (Render.com):</strong> Our app's core functionality is powered by our backend API. This service acts as the bridge between the app and other third-party services. We send your profile data (like job role), chat history, and self-assessment answers to this backend to process your requests.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Service Providers (e.g., OpenAI):</strong> To generate chat responses and AI feedback, we send the relevant text (like your chat messages or practice answers) and your chat history (for context) to an AI API.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Hosting & Database (Google Firebase):</strong> We use Firebase for user authentication, cloud database storage (Firestore for your profile, chat history, and all saved content like notes and questions), and analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Speech-to-Text Services:</strong> Your audio recordings are processed by a transcription service (like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) via our backend to convert them to text.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Search APIs (e.g., Jsearch):</strong> To find job listings, we may send search parameters (like job title, location, and skills) to a third-party job API.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>To provide its full functionality, RozgarAI requests the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Internet (android.permission.INTERNET):</strong>
                Required to connect to the internet to fetch data from our backend, AI services, and job APIs.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Microphone (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO):</strong>
                Required *only* if you use the voice input feature. This allows us to capture your speech for transcription.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Notifications (android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong>
                (On Android 13+) Allows the App to send you notifications for chat replies and checklist reminders.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Set Exact Alarms (android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM):</strong>
                (On Android 12+) This permission is required *only* if you use the "Set Reminder" feature in the checklist. It allows the app to schedule and trigger your task reminders reliably, even if the app is in the background.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information as long as your account is active. You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data at any time through the app's settings. Upon request, we will permanently delete your data from our active systems within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>RozgarAI is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of material changes by posting the new policy in the App. We encourage you to review it regularly.</p>
