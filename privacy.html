        <h2>5. App Permissions Explained</h2>
        <p>Our App requests the following permissions to enable specific features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Internet (android.permission.INTERNET):</strong>
                <strong>Why:</strong> Required for all network activity, including logging in, syncing your data, communicating with our backend, fetching AI responses, and loading job data.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Microphone (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO):</strong>
                <strong>Why:</strong> Required *only* if you choose to use the voice input (microphone) feature. This allows the App to capture your speech for transcription. If you do not grant this, only the voice feature will be disabled.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Notifications (android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong>
                <strong>Why:</strong> (On Android 13+) Allows the App to send you helpful notifications, such as when you receive a new chat reply (if the app is in the background) or when a task reminder you set is due.
            </li>
            <li class="permission-item">
                <strong>Set Exact Alarms (android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM):</strong>
                <strong>Why:</strong> (On Android 12+) This permission is required *only* if you use the "Set Reminder" feature in the checklist. It is necessary to ensure your task reminders can trigger reliably at the exact time you set, even if the device is idle.
            </li>
        </ul>
